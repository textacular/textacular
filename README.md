# textacular

Further documentation available at http://textacular.github.com/textacular.


## DESCRIPTION:

Textacular exposes full text search capabilities from PostgreSQL,
extending ActiveRecord with scopes making search easy and fun!


## FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Only works with PostgreSQL


## SYNOPSIS:

### Quick Start

#### Rails 3 (or 4!)

In the project's Gemfile add

    gem 'textacular', '~> 3.0', require: 'textacular/rails'


#### ActiveRecord outside of Rails

```ruby
require 'textacular'

ActiveRecord::Base.extend(Textacular)
```


### Usage

Your models now have access to search methods:

The `#basic_search` method is what you might expect: it looks literally for what
you send to it, doing nothing fancy with the input:

```ruby
Game.basic_search('Sonic') # will search through the model's :string columns
Game.basic_search(title: 'Mario', system: 'Nintendo')
```

The `#advanced_search` method lets you use Postgres's search syntax like '|',
'&' and '!' ('or', 'and', and 'not') as well as some other craziness. Check [the
Postgres
docs](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/datatype-textsearch.html) for more:

```ruby
Game.advanced_search(title: 'Street|Fantasy')
Game.advanced_search(system: '!PS2')
```

Finally, the `#fuzzy_search` method lets you use Postgres's trigram search
funcionality:

```ruby
Comic.fuzzy_search(title: 'Questio') # matches Questionable Content
```

Searches are also chainable:

```ruby
Game.fuzzy_search(title: 'tree').basic_search(system: 'SNES')
```

If you want to search on two or more fields with the OR operator use a hash for the conditions and pass false as 
the second parameter:
```ruby
Game.basic_search({name: 'Mario', nickname: 'Mario'}, false)
```
### Setting Language

To set proper searching dictionary just override class method on your model:

```ruby
def self.searchable_language
  'russian'
end
```

And all your queries would go right! And don`t forget to change the migration for indexes, like shown below.


### Creating Indexes for Super Speed
You can have Postgresql use an index for the full-text search.  To declare a full-text index, in a
migration add code like the following:

```ruby
execute "
    create index on email_logs using gin(to_tsvector('english', subject));
    create index on email_logs using gin(to_tsvector('english', email_address));"
```

In the above example, the table email_logs has two text columns that we search against, subject and email_address.
You will need to add an index for every text/string column you query against, or else Postgresql will revert to a
full table scan instead of using the indexes.

If you create these indexes, you should also switch to sql for your schema_format in `config/application.rb`:

```ruby
config.active_record.schema_format = :sql
```
