# textacular

Further documentation available at http://textacular.github.com/textacular.


## DESCRIPTION:

Textacular exposes full text search capabilities from PostgreSQL,
extending ActiveRecord with scopes making search easy and fun!


## FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Only works with PostgreSQL


## SYNOPSIS:

### Quick Start

#### Rails 3 (or 4!)

In the project's Gemfile add

```ruby
gem 'textacular', '~> 3.0'
```

#### ActiveRecord outside of Rails

```ruby
require 'textacular'

ActiveRecord::Base.extend(Textacular)
```


### Usage

Your models now have access to search methods:

The `#basic_search` method is what you might expect: it looks literally for what
you send to it, doing nothing fancy with the input:

```ruby
Game.basic_search('Sonic') # will search through the model's :string columns
Game.basic_search(title: 'Mario', system: 'Nintendo')
```

The `#advanced_search` method lets you use Postgres's search syntax like '|',
'&' and '!' ('or', 'and', and 'not') as well as some other craziness. The ideal
use for advanced_search is to take a search DSL you make up for your users and
translate it to PG's syntax. If for some reason you want to put user input
directly into an advanced search, you should be sure to catch exceptions from
syntax errors. Check [the Postgres docs]
(http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/datatype-textsearch.html) for more:

```ruby
Game.advanced_search(title: 'Street|Fantasy')
Game.advanced_search(system: '!PS2')
```

Finally, the `#fuzzy_search` method lets you use Postgres's trigram search
functionality.

In order to use this, you'll need to make sure your database has the `pg_trgm`
module installed. Create and run a migration to install the module:

```
rake textacular:create_trigram_migration
rake db:migrate
```

Once that's installed, you can use it like this:

```ruby
Comic.fuzzy_search(title: 'Questio') # matches Questionable Content
```

Note that fuzzy searches are subject to a similarity threshold imposed by the `pg_trgm` module. The default is 0.3, meaning that at least 30% of the total string must match your search content. For example:

```ruby
Comic.fuzzy_search(title: 'Pearls') # matches Pearls Before Swine
Comic.fuzzy_search(title: 'Pear') # does not match Pearls Before Swine
```

For more info, view the `pg_trgm` documentation, specifically [F.35.2. Functions and Operators](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/pgtrgm.html).

Searches are also chainable:

```ruby
Game.fuzzy_search(title: 'tree').basic_search(system: 'SNES')
```

If you want to search on two or more fields with the OR operator use a hash for
the conditions and pass false as the second parameter:

```ruby
Game.basic_search({name: 'Mario', nickname: 'Mario'}, false)
```


### Setting Language

To set proper searching dictionary just override class method on your model:

```ruby
def self.searchable_language
  'russian'
end
```

And all your queries would go right! And don`t forget to change the migration for indexes, like shown below.


### Creating Indexes for Super Speed
You can have Postgresql use an index for the full-text search.  To declare a full-text index, in a
migration add code like the following:

```ruby
execute "
    create index on email_logs using gin(to_tsvector('english', subject));
    create index on email_logs using gin(to_tsvector('english', email_address));"
```

In the above example, the table email_logs has two text columns that we search against, subject and email_address.
You will need to add an index for every text/string column you query against, or else Postgresql will revert to a
full table scan instead of using the indexes.

If you create these indexes, you should also switch to sql for your schema_format in `config/application.rb`:

```ruby
config.active_record.schema_format = :sql
```

### Searching JSON or other non-text fields

You can search Postgres' JSON field (or other fields that are not textual) by converting them to text. For JSON
fields this might look like:

```ruby
Game.fuzzy_search({"data->>a" => 'Mario', "data->>b" => 'Mario'}, false)
```

The Postgres JSON operator `->>` converts the field to a text type. You can also just use `cast(column as text)` in the same way for other non text fields. If you want to search all fields.

For Array fields you can use `array_to_string(array, text_delimiter)`.

```ruby
Game.fuzzy_search({"array_to_string(list, ' '" => 'Mario'}, false)
```

## REQUIREMENTS:

* ActiveRecord
* Ruby 1.9.2


## INSTALL:

```
$ gem install textacular
```

## Contributing

Help is gladly welcomed. If you have a feature you'd like to add, it's much more
likely to get in (or get in faster) the closer you stick to these steps:

1. Open an Issue to talk about it. We can discuss whether it's the right
  direction or maybe help track down a bug, etc.
1. Fork the project, and make a branch to work on your feature/fix. Master is
  where you'll want to start from.
1. Write a test for the feature you are about to add
1. Run the tests
1. Turn the Issue into a Pull Request. There are several ways to do this, but
  [hub](https://github.com/defunkt/hub) is probably the easiest.
1. Bonus points if your Pull Request updates `CHANGES.md` to include a summary
   of your changes and your name like the other entries. If the last entry is
   the last release, add a new `## Unreleased` heading.

If you don't know how to fix something, even just a Pull Request that includes a
failing test can be helpful. If in doubt, make an Issue to discuss.
